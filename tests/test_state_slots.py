"""Host-only tests for per-request device state slots.

A persistent-batch ROW is not stable for a request: ``_update_states`` evicts a
running request the step does not schedule (every prefill step does) and re-adds it
at whatever row is free, and ``condense`` moves rows down when a request finishes.
Device state indexed by slot (Qwen3.6 GDN recurrent+conv, the per-slot seed RNG, the
decode trace's token/position buffers) does not follow, so
``_alloc_prefill_state_slots`` and ``_decode_state_slot_remap`` say where each
request's state is. No device execution: both are pure index bookkeeping, run here
against a fake runner.
