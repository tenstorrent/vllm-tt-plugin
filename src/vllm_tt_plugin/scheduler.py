class TTScheduler(AsyncScheduler):
    """Scheduler for the TT (Tenstorrent) platform.

    TT constraints:
    - No mixed prefill+decode batches: each batch is either all-prefill
      or all-decode.
    - Token-chunked prefill is allowed: a long prefill may be split across
      steps. After a partial chunk the base scheduler keeps the request in
      ``running`` with ``is_prefill_chunk=True``; later prefill steps schedule
      the next chunk until the prompt is fully computed. Those continuations
      count as prefill work here, never as decodes.

    The base scheduler holds temporarily blocked prefill requests (e.g. while
    a structured-output grammar compiles) in ``skipped_waiting`` rather than
    ``waiting``. Its prefill loop revisits that queue and promotes requests
    whose dependency is ready. Decode-only scheduling must hide both queues so
    that the base scheduler cannot admit a prefill into a decode step.

    Inherits from AsyncScheduler to get num_output_placeholders support.
    TT uses this scheduler in both sync and async execution modes:
    - with async_scheduling=False, it behaves as the single TT scheduler
      without execution overlap
    - with async_scheduling=True, placeholders allow decode requests to be
      re-scheduled before update_from_output processes the previous step's
      results, enabling host/device overlap
    - under async scheduling a preempted request keeps the tokens it had
      already scheduled but not yet received, and needs no TT-side handling
      for them. Those tokens are valid: the forward that produced them ran to
      completion before the preempt freed any block, device submits form a
      strict queue, and every async op is forced to complete before the next
      prefill, so no later write can reach the KV they were computed against.
      The base class appends them on arrival and the resumed prefill replays
      them. ``Request.async_tokens_to_discard`` serves the wholesale
      ``reset_prefix_cache`` teardown only; wiring ordinary preemption into it
      drops valid tokens and silently truncates the response.
      A preempted request with an outstanding output placeholder stays in the
      waiting queue until that valid frame is accounted for. Resuming earlier
      would replay and sample against the old token history, producing a second
      physical frame for the same single placeholder and advancing seeded RNG
      state for a token that must be discarded.

    Supports ``set_forced_mode`` for lane coordination:
    - ``TTSchedulingMode.DECODE_ONLY`` forces decode-only (even if waiting
      queue is non-empty).
    - ``TTSchedulingMode.PREFILL_ONLY`` forces prefill-only (and may return an
      empty batch when there is no pending prefill work).
    - ``TTSchedulingMode.DEFAULT`` uses the default policy: prefer prefill
      when pending prefill work exists, but fall back to decode-only if
      prefill cannot make progress and running decode requests exist.

        The model keeps one global session: drafter taps are captured during a

        multi-token block. Every transition of that session is driven by the
        shape of a step, so the scheduler can mirror it exactly without asking
        the model -- and that is what keeps the width this scheduler RESERVES
        equal to the width the model EMITS:

        * a PREFILL step re-seats the session. The model captures taps only for
          a solo, spec-eligible prefill and drops the session on any other
          prefill (batched, or a prompt over the capture frontier).
        * a BATCHED decode step destroys it. The model releases the decoder and
          serves plain baseline from then on, and it never re-arms, because
          taps only ever come from a prefill. This is the case that made a
          benchmark sweep fail: as concurrency drains back to one request, that
          request is solo and eligible but no longer owns a session.
        * a SOLO decode by the OWNER leaves ownership alone -- it bootstraps
          its pending taps and keeps the session for the rest of its life.
        * a SOLO decode by ANY OTHER request destroys it. Async scheduling can
          skip the owner once it has reached max_tokens (upstream guards that
          skip on num_output_placeholders), leaving a different request alone
          on the next step while the session is still armed. The model releases
          the session on that step for the same reason -- it would otherwise
          speculate from the owner's residual taps -- and this mirrors that
          release, so the reserved width stays 1 for the non-owner
          (vllm-tt-plugin#118.1).
