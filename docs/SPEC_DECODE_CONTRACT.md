# Speculative decoding: what a tt-metal model must implement

This is the model-side contract the plugin admits against. A tt-metal model
class that wants speculative decoding through this plugin implements everything
below. The plugin side that reads it is
`src/vllm_tt_plugin/spec_admission.py`, and the value types it exchanges are
`src/vllm_tt_plugin/spec_decode.py`.

The design this implements is
https://github.com/tenstorrent/vllm-tt-plugin/issues/110.

## 1. Capability declarations

Four `model_capabilities` entries, read only when the launch carries a
`speculative_config`. Absent keys default as shown, following the plugin's
existing default-if-absent convention.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `supports_spec_decode` | `False` | Master gate. Absent means the model cannot serve any speculative configuration. |
| `spec_requirements` | `[]` | What the drafter can serve: `device_propose`, `hidden_feed`, `drafter_scores`, `paged_drafter_cache`. |
| `spec_hidden_handoff` | `[]` | How the target hidden state reaches a device drafter: `on_device`, `roundtrip`. Required when the method needs `hidden_feed`. |
| `output_tokens_per_step` | `1` | Must stay `1`. A value above 1 selects the block-output rail, which cannot be combined with speculation. |

A model never names a vLLM speculative method. The plugin owns the mapping from
a method name to the requirements that method places on the model, so a new
upstream method is a plugin change rather than a model release.

## 2. The `spec_plan` classmethod

```python
@classmethod
def spec_plan(cls, vllm_config, max_num_seqs: int, requested_k: int) -> SpecPlan | SpecReject
```

Called once per process at configuration time, before any instance exists. The
plugin calls it positionally, so parameter names are not part of the contract.

**Arguments.** `max_num_seqs` is the concurrency the plan is dimensioned
against, and it is the value that is final for the launch, after the platform
has folded data parallelism into lanes. `requested_k` is the operator's
`num_speculative_tokens`.

**`vllm_config` carries no Tenstorrent platform state.** A `spec_plan`
implementation must not call `get_tt_output_tokens_per_step`,
`get_tt_data_parallel_size` or any other `get_tt_*` helper on it: the platform
has not stored them at that point, so two of those return a default of 1
silently and `require_tt_output_tokens_per_step` raises.

**Returns** a `SpecPlan` when the model can serve that point, or a `SpecReject`
when it cannot. It must not raise, and it must not return anything else.

**Rules the plugin enforces.** `effective_k` must not exceed `requested_k`; a
model that can serve less returns a lower value and a model that can serve
nothing returns `SpecReject`. `drafter_state` must not be `paged`, which needs
a scheduler-owned drafter cache the plugin does not yet allocate.
`accept_modes` must offer at least one of `logits` or `argmax_ids`; offering
`fused_sample` in addition is fine and does not make the model less admissible.

**`SpecReject.supported_k`** carries the draft lengths that would have worked at
that concurrency, and the plugin quotes it to the operator. Populate it.

## 3. `SpecPlan` fields

See `src/vllm_tt_plugin/spec_decode.py` for the authoritative definitions and
their validation. In summary: `effective_k` is the draft length the model will
actually serve; `lanes_per_request` is the decode rows one speculating request
occupies, which is not a lane-DP lane; `extra_bytes_per_seq` and
`extra_bytes_per_token` are the device bytes a speculating request costs, fixed
and per KV token respectively; `accept_modes` names what the verify call
returns; `drafter_state` says where the drafter's own state lives; and
`drafter_target_cache_requires` carries what a drafter sharing the target's
caches needs to stay true of them.

`lanes_per_request`, `extra_bytes_per_seq` and `extra_bytes_per_token` are
declared but not yet budgeted against. The byte fields need a bytes-per-KV-token
conversion the block-count function does not have, and the row check needs the
runner. Declare them accurately anyway: they are what the budgeting will read.

## 4. What the plugin does with a refusal

Every refusal raises `ValueError` at configuration time, naming the offending
values and the command-line flag that changes them. Speculation is never
disabled silently, because a server that accepts the flags and serves no
speculation reports a speedup it did not achieve.
